    Read me file for the RL78 Flash Data Library T04
===============================================================================

The Flash Data Library T04 (Pico) offers the user an easy to use interface to
directly access the data flash. This library aims at a reduced feature set in
order to enable Data-Flash access on small devices. Hence, there is no EEPROM
emulation library available from Renesas which operates on the Flash Data
Library T04. Please refer to the documentation for a detailed description.

The following features are supported by the Flash Data Library T04:

Configurable size of user and EEL pool size:                NO
Access authority check (user pool and EEL pool):            NO
Access size (read, write, blank-check, verify):             1 to 1024 bytes
Access size (erase):                                        1 block (1024 bytes)
Operating modes:                                            Polling
Request/Response-oriented dialog:                           NO
Standby/wakeup feature:                                     NO
Automatic suspend/resume of block-oriented commands:        NO
Automatic priority control for user access:                 NO
Automatic priority control for block- and
                               byte/word-oriented commands: NO
"Read at any time" capability:                              NO
Secure open/close synchronization between FDL and EEL:      NO
EEL support:                                                NO

Please note that in addition to the Flash Data Library T04 there are other
Flash Data Libraries available from Renesas with different feature sets and
resource consumptions.

The following libraries are also provided for download:

- RL78 Flash Data Library T01        (Installer: RENESAS_FDL_RL78_T01E_Vx.xx)
- RL78 Flash Data Library T02 (Tiny) (Installer: RENESAS_FDL_RL78_T02E_Vx.xx)

3. File Naming
========================================

Installer
---------
    The installer file has the name RENESAS_FDL_RL78_TxxE_V{x}.{y}{z}.exe
    e.g. RENESAS_FDL_RL78_TxxE_V1.00.exe
    
    {x} This version digit will be incremented in case of major changes e.g. API
        changes
    {y} This version digit will be incremented in case of bug fixes and internal
        improvements
    {z} This version digit will be incremented in case of adding support of new
        devices

How to integrate
----------------
    1) copy all the files into your project subdirectory
    2) add all pfdl*.* files into your project (workbench or make-file)
    3) adapt the sample linker file to your requirements
       --> at least the segment PFDL_COD should be defined
    4) re-compile the project
